# Seismic Intensity Detection System (SIDS) üåç

In this project The Seismic Intensity Detection System (SIDS) uses the DE10-Standard FPGA board to detect and measure seismic activities. The system integrates an accelerometer for data acquisition, an LED for intensity indication, a 7-segment display for displaying numerical data, and buttons for user input.

Technologies and Tools:
* DE10-Standard Board 
* Accelerometer: Captures x, y, z acceleration.
* LED and 7-Segment Display: For visual feedback on seismic intensity and data.
* Buttons: Allows users to interact with the system for commands.
* VHDL: Implements the digital logic on the 7-segment display and Possibly LED
* C Programming Language: Utilized for developing embedded software, potentially for handling more complex data processing or interfacing tasks.
* Quartus Prime: For VHDL programming, offering tools for Pin Planning, simulation, and programming.
* Visual Studio Code: Serves as the IDE for writing and managing C code.

The approach combines VHDL for FPGA-based logic design with C programming for managing  peripheral interactions. This dual-language strategy enhances flexibility in handling intricate system functionalities and user interactions.
